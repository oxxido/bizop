  <p class="lead">Can you tell the difference between a get rich quick scam and a real, legitimate business opportunity? I sure couldn’t when I first started my trek to making money on the Internet. Sadly, there are probably more scams, cons, rip-offs, and just generally bad business investments now than when I started.</p>

  <p>Hi, my name is Dr. David Lelievre and I have found success through various online business opportunities. I remember what drove me to look for Biz Ops; I wanted to move away from my long-standing career as a dentist to spend more time with my family and friends. I heard there was money to be made in affiliate marketing, Internet marketing, MLMs and various Biz Ops. Sound familiar? </p>
  <p>My path was not without stumbles and letdowns, just like many others. I invested more than $200K in the wrong opportunities and several Internet marketing educational programs that did not equip me with the tools and knowledge to really succeed in an affiliate marketing or MLM environment. I started to feel discouraged. </p>
  <p>After a few years of trying, I decided to switch my tactics. I put more time into research and joined a highly recommended Internet training program, High Traffic Academy. It completely turned my life around. Now, I am able to work from home and see a real return on not just my initial investment, but future investments I have made since then. </p>
  <p>On my path to success, I have come across many who have experienced similar letdowns, or who still struggle to find the right business opportunities. This is why I started Biz Op Reports. I had a desire to share my knowledge, so hopefully others would not experience the same loss in investment of their time and money. I wanted Biz Op Reports to be a hub for others to voice their opinions as well – a community where people could trust in the reviews and information they were receiving! </p>
  <p>There were several ways I sought to achieve this. Biz Op Reports takes great care in reviewing your submissions, and we present the ones that YOU vote up! This ensures legitimacy and a general consensus for the reviews being shared with our members! We continually are looking for ways to build trust with the general public and business professionals such as yourself. </p>
  <p>We pride ourselves on being ethical and honest, and we have no hidden agenda. Our mission is simply to provide unbiased reviews and resources that will hopefully help you not only save time and money, but make money online as well. </p>
